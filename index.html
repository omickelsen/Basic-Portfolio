    <h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="assets/images/orie and cassidy sunvalley.jpg" alt="Orie and Cassidy" width="300">If I had to use a word to discribe myself I would start off with the word <strong>"Gorilla"</strong>. The reason I choose this word is because when I think of a gorilla, I think of a few things. Majestic, Mighty, intelligent, fierce, and leader. These are many of the characteristics that I contain. I'm 26 years old and I am married to the love of my life Cassidy Mickelsen. She is my better half. I was born and raised in Utah, on a farm. Learned how to be a hardworker from a young age. I graduated from the University of Utah in Economics. Worked as a financial advisor for about a year and a half before I decided to seek my true passion in Web Development. I love my family and friends and I enjoy working with computers and having a great work life balance.
Personal hobbies that I have are, crossfit, basketball, video games, hunting, fishing, and all outdoor activities. I'm always looking to move up in my career and learn as much as I possibly can.<br>
